# GetWrite — Frontend (UI skeleton)

This folder contains the UI-only frontend scaffold for the `001-ui-getwrite-skeleton` feature. It is a placeholder-driven Next.js app built for component-first iteration.

Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

Quickstart (recommended)

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # start Next.js dev server
pnpm storybook    # start Storybook on :6006
pnpm test -- --run# run Vitest tests
```

Notes

- The UI is placeholder-only for now; no backend persistence is implemented.
- Use Storybook to iterate on components before integrating into pages.
