## Global Operating Contract

This specification operates under the project-wide Copilot Operating Contract
defined at:

.github/copilot-instructions.md

If conflicts arise between this spec-scoped instruction file and the global
operating contract:

1. Explicit user instructions override all.
2. Active specification scope applies within its defined boundaries.
3. Global operating constraints (template integrity, package selection,
   TypeScript discipline, etc.) remain authoritative.

Do not ignore the global operating contract.
