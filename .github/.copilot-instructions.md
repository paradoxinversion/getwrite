# Copilot Operating Contract

This file defines how Copilot interprets project authority.

---

## Authority Order

When generating code or configuration, follow this order:

1. Active specification (if present)
2. Existing repository code
3. Canonical documents in /docs
4. Explicit user instructions
5. General ecosystem conventions

Higher authority overrides lower authority.

If a specification conflicts with existing code,
follow the specification and limit changes to the defined scope.

---

## Controlled Inference

If details are missing:

- Infer only what is necessary to implement the specification.
- Keep assumptions minimal and consistent with existing patterns.
- Do not introduce unrelated tools, upgrades, or architectural changes.

If uncertainty affects architectural direction, dependency choice, data shape, or public API design:

- Pause and ask for clarification.
- Offer concise options if helpful.
- Defer to the user’s decision.

If the user explicitly allows Copilot to choose, proceed with the most conservative and consistent option.

---

## Consistency First

Match existing repository patterns unless the specification explicitly defines a new pattern.

---

## Scope Discipline

Implement only what the specification or prompt defines.
Do not refactor, modernize, or improve unrelated code.

---

## Standards Proposal Protocol

If Copilot detects a recurring pattern, missing convention, or decision that would benefit from formalization:

- Propose a concise standard draft.
- Suggest placement in `/docs`.
- Do not enforce the proposed standard until approved.
- Do not retroactively refactor code to match a proposed standard.

The user must explicitly approve, modify, or reject the proposed standard before it becomes authoritative.

Once approved and added to `/docs`, it becomes part of the Authority Order.

---

## Conflict Handling

If higher-authority sources conflict in a way that prevents implementation,
pause and request clarification before proceeding.

---

## Command Failure Escalation Protocol

If Copilot attempts to execute or suggest a command and it fails repeatedly due to using the wrong command:

- After 3 failed attempts, reassess assumptions and adjust approach.
- After 5 failed attempts for the same task, stop retrying.

At that point:

- Ask the user whether they know the correct command.
- Do not continue guessing or iterating blindly.

If the user provides the correct command:

- Use the provided command.
- Propose adding it to the appropriate `/docs` file as a canonical command reference.
- Do not modify documentation without explicit approval.

Once approved and documented, the command becomes authoritative under the Authority Order.

---

## Vertical Completion Rule

When implementing a specification:

- Deliver a complete, runnable vertical slice unless the specification explicitly stages the work.
- Do not leave placeholder scaffolding when implementation is feasible.
- Do not defer implementation solely due to minor ambiguity.

---

## Minor Ambiguity Handling

If ambiguity does not affect public APIs, architecture, or external behavior:

- Choose the simplest consistent option.
- Do not escalate for clarification.

---

## Early Pattern Evolution

During early feature development:

- Patterns may evolve across iterations.
- Do not treat the first implementation as immutable precedent.
- Apply refinements within the active specification scope.

---

## Readability and Function Size

Code must prioritize human readability over cleverness or density.

- Prefer small, single-responsibility functions.
- Keep functions as short as reasonably possible.
- Avoid deep nesting.
- Extract logic into named helpers instead of embedding complex expressions.
- Prefer explicit steps over condensed one-liners.
- Do not compress logic for brevity.
- Do not introduce abstractions that reduce clarity.

Since all code will be reviewed by a human:

- Optimize for clarity and traceability.
- Make control flow easy to follow.
- Favor straightforward structure over DRY if DRY reduces readability.

---

## Implementation Mode

Stack-specific implementation standards apply only when:

- The task explicitly involves writing or modifying source code.
- The user indicates implementation work.
- A specification has moved into execution.

During planning, architecture, or specification drafting,
ignore language-specific implementation standards.

When in doubt, ask whether the task is in implementation mode.

When in Implementation Mode, also follow:

- /docs/standards/typescript-implementation.md
- /docs/standards/package-selection.md
